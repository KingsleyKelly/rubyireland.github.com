And for all you Ruby lovin&apos; joggers out there that need something to listen to while running round the park - 
it's also been released in [MP3 format](https://soundcloud.com/rubyireland/poodr-talk-by-chris-mcgrath) on SoundCloud. 

Thanks again to everyone who attend and helped to make it such a great evening and [Intercom](http://intercom.io) for hosting.
