Welcome to the new Ruby Ireland website, dedicated to all things ruby & rails. Watch out for the RI community updating the site with all kinds of ruby goodness. Meanwhile you can you find us on the [Ruby Ireland Google Group](http://groups.google.ie/group/ruby_ireland).

Also give some love to our generous sponsors, [dediserve](https://www.dediserve.com/) for giving donating a VPS server for this site & also members' projects & to [jolt online](http://joltonline.com/) for sponsoring food & beer for the Ruby Ireland meetup held every month.
