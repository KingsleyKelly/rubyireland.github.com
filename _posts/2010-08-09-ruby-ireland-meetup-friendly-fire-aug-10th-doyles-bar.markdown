A little break from tradition of presentation-oriented meetups, the next Ruby Ireland meetup will be in Doyle's bar (across from Trinity College), Dublin ([www.doylesintown.com](www.doylesintown.com)) from 6pm. But sure isn't change as good as a holiday!

Every Tuesday, Doyle's have a "Ruby Sessions" music event. Looking at the RubySessions.com website, this week's confirmed acts are Fiach, Jennifer Evans and Renny Field who will be playing from 9pm.

For a bit of Ruby coding talk topped off by some top tunes, catch you in Doyle's this Tuesday!
