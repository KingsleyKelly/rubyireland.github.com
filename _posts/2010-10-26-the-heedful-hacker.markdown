I'm delighted that [Security Ninja David Rook](http://www.securityninja.co.uk/blog) will be giving a talk at the next Ruby Ireland meetup, I first heard of David a couple of years ago and then after going to one of his talks I  realised how little I really knew about security!
If you haven't been to any of David's talks before && || are a bit rusty when it comes to security you should come along. As usual it's on in the trinity capital hotel at 7pm on Nov. 16th avec food & beer.

Hope to see you all there.
