It's the last meetup of the year and thanks to Storyful and PlayON.co it is going to be a cracker! We've got talks on the challenges of scaling architecture and testing Rails apps. And not only are they putting up the speakers but they're also putting their money where their mouth is by sponsoring, not one, but two end of year parties! Here's the schedule...

<table class="scheduleTable">
  <tr><td class="scheduleTableFirstCol">6:00-6:45pm</td><td>Pre-meetup party at Slattery's bar, sponsored by PlayON.co</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7:00pm</td><td>Doors open at Engine Yard</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7:20pm</td><td>Talk 1: Challenges of Architecture and Scaling at PlayON.co by Killian Jones</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7:50pm</td><td>Talk 2: Testing Rails Apps by Storyful's Tony Byrne</td></tr>
  <tr><td>8:45pm-late</td><td>After Party at Ely HQ, sponsored by Storyful</td></tr>
</table>

  
As ever, there will be RubyMine licences up for grabs and as well as a big thanks going out to Engine Yard for hosting us. So close out 2014 in style. You know all you want for Christmas is make it down to our end of year bash and meet your fellow Rubyists!
