Some more posts by the guys @logentries, this time with a Heroku twist...

The first post covers their relatively new Heroku add-on and how it notifies you when bad things are happening under the hood of your apps. [Don't let your heroku apps fail silently](https://blog.logentries.com/2012/02/dont-let-your-heroku-apps-fail-silently/) seems to be the mantra.

[The second post](https://blog.logentries.com/2012/05/collecting-heroku-exception-stack-traces/) is in relation to an annoying issue with Heroku logs where stack traces can have unrelated events interleaved in them, and how this is handled by a new addition to the Logentries service.
