Thanks to everyone who made it down to Oisin Hurley's talk at the last Ruby Ireland meetup. It was a great talk and a great night! For those of you who couldn't make it, the good news is that you can [catch up online](http://www.codemongrel.com/the-ruby-ireland-sessions-constructing-web-apis-with-rack-sinatra-and-mongodb-by-oisin-hurley/) through video or audio.

Thanks again to Jolt for sponsoring the food on the night. And a massive thanks to Kevin Noonan for organising the event, Matt Hutchinson for the video work and Oisin for talking.
