After the fantastic meetup at the end of August (thanks again to [@Logentries](https://logentries.com/) and [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/) for a fantastic night!), we will gather again on Thursday 8th September from 7pm at [AMWorks](http://amworks.ie) for another Ruby Project Night. All welcome so hope to see some of you there!
