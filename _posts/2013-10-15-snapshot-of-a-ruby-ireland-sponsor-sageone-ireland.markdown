title: Snapshot of a Ruby Ireland Sponsor - SageOne Ireland
author: declan
---


We've had a lot of different sponsors behind Ruby Ireland over the last
few years. One notable addition to that list is
[SageOne](http://www.sageone.ie/), who have super
generously stumped up the cash for the pizza bill at each of the last
meetups and continue to do so. No mean feat, given that the size of has
been trending upwards as 2013 rumbles on! We thought it would be timely
to see what their backstory is and how Ruby is used within SageOne.

First, it's probably good to give a heads up on what the SageOne is.
SageOne is Sage's suite of cloud accounting and payroll products, run as
it's own unit within Sage. Being cloud oriented, SageOne has its own
ways of working and processes. So expect developer-friendly words like
Scrum, Git and TDD - along with a focus on UX and an upbeat tempo - as
opposed to chasing waterfalls! Jean Vecchia the Product Development
Manager at SageOne explained a little more about their Ruby operation
and why they're putting so much sponsorship into Ruby Ireland.

_"We have been developing Ruby applications for over 3 years and it is
our chosen technology for our cloud based solutions.  During that time
we have learnt a lot (some things the hard way!). Up to now we have had
our own Ruby community across the Sage Globe (IRL, UK, US, Canada,
Germany Spain, France, and more) but we want to share that knowledge
outside of Sage, as well as being really interested in how others are
approaching software development. It’s a great way to stay current and
at the same time give something back including pizza! We're currently
[hiring Ruby devs](http://www.rubyjobs.ie/?search=sageone) and Ruby
Ireland is a great place to meet them. If you
want to know more come over and talk to me at the meet ups or drop me an
email jean.vecchia@sage.com"_


SageOne developer Kevin Browne will be sharing lessons learned from
reimplementing an existing DSL in Ruby at this Tuesday's meetup - Ruby
Rules! If you want to
come along please RSVP at the [link](http://www.meetup.com/rubyireland/events/144658952/)
which gives Jean an idea of how much
pepperoni to set aside for the evening :-)

Hopefully, after reading this you now have a little more insight into
what difference the "One" on the end of SageOne means. A big thanks to
them for the sponsorship of Ruby Ireland and helping ease the logistical
pressures on the organisers!
