[This blog post](https://blog.logentries.com/2012/09/how-do-i-know-if-my-heroku-app-is-slow/) from Logentries covers understanding request latency for Heroku apps, in particular under high user loads. It focuses on analysing your logs in production environments and understanding what to do about certain heroku error codes.

The Logentries add-on for Heroku allows users to find **request time outs** (H12 errors) or **backlog too deep** errors (H11) with preconfigured intelligent tagging, graphs, and real-time email/ mobile alerts.
