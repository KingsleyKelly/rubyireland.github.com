<h1>Ruby/Rails meetup in Cork</h1>

<p>There is a small Ruby Ireland group which meets in Cork on the first Wednesday of every month. This has been running since January 2010 (with a hiatus in 2011, but back in 2012-) and provides a informal setting for Ruby developers to meet</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Where:</b> Clarion Hotel lobby, Lapps Quay, Cork city</li>
<li><b>When:</b> from about 7:30pm on the first Wednesday of every month</li>
<li><b>What:</b> Informal discussions and demos on anything Ruby- or Rails-related, or in the</li> wider context of startups and tech news.
<li><b>Who:</b> Anyone interested in Ruby or Rails development. If you’re wondering what Rails is about we’ll be happy to demo an app, walk through some code and help you get started on your own.</li>
